# Zigtools Playground

Run and explore Zig in your browser, with compiler and LSP support built in.

## Installation

You can either:

- Use it online: https://playground.zigtools.org/
- Run it locally:

Requires Zig `0.15.1`. Will automatically fetch Zig along with ZLS, compiling both for webassembly.

```bash
zig build
npm install
npm run dev
```

Enjoy!
